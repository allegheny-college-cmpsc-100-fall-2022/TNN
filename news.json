As the Mayor commented with clear intent for O.M.E.N. to report, \"the people of term-world are only of any value to me if they are complacent. We want prestiege; we want popularity; we want...PIZZAZZ!\"</p><p>So get your doo-dads, gadgets, and widgets underway, folks; it's time to engage in some entertainment. Since built, the once-promising neighborhood bodegas have experienced marginal business. To reap the full benefit of the Mayor's original economic stimulus plan, the bodegas strewn throughout term-world need a few landmark draws to keep kids spending their easily-obtained quarters, and the people generally distracted.</p><p>Citizens await the latest crop of cool new games to emerge from the latest effort to excite local economies. Will yours be the next big thing to come from term-world? Will it fill that hard-to-define, missing niche in citizens' souls only quenchable by playing past the next level? Will it have, dare we write, PIZZAZZ?</p>"
