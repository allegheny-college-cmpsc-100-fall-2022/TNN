  "text": "Last week The Mayor unveiled a new beautification program in an effort to make term-world the spot to be. This is the latest in a long line of proposals, projects, programs, and plans that The Mayor has been fervently working on to drive both tourism and residency within term-world.<br/><br/>This particular program targets the tight-knit communities that lie on the outskirts of our fair term-world. The appeal of neighborhoods like Roobrik and Balzare has gone under the microscope, and according to The Mayor, it has been found sorely wanting.<br/><br/>Partnering with The Landlord that exercises ownership over these despondent, dismal, and downright depressing domestic hovels, The Mayor has decreed that all building exteriors in the targeted communities must meet certain specific \"Beautification Standard\" metrics, within a week's time. Once the one week grace period is up, The Mayor is planning on leveraging his authority as The Mayor to evict non-compliant residents."
