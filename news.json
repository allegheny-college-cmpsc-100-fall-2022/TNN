  "text": "A bold new proposal from The Mayor promises to make money waves of magnificent magnitudes in the shallower parts of term-world's economic landscape. The Mayor refers to his brainchild as \"Prop Stop n' Shop\", an apt name for a measure meant to meaningfully magnify the microeconomies of myriad term-world neighborhoods.<br/><br/>\"Prop Stop n' Shop\" sets aside nearly 10% of each residential area's acreage for purely profitable purposes. It's The Mayor's hope that this endeavor will help jumpstart a jetlagged economy--putting a little more jingle-jangle in our citizen's jean pockets.<br/></br>The Mayor is formally tasking the residents of each neighborhood with the creation of a neighborhood bodega that might showcase the unique cultures (and commercial capabilities) of each of term-world's compact communities. We wager that within a week or two we should witness the wonders of their work--our wallets certainly can't wait!"
